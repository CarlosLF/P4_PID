# PID Controler Project

In this project a PID controller has been implemented, the PID controller gets feedback from the simulator and returns the steereing angle.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
2. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
3. Run it: `./pid`. 



## Student describes the effect of the P, I, D component of the PID algorithm in their implementation. Is it what you expected?

Visual aids are encouraged, i.e. record of a small video of the car in the simulator and describe what each component is set to.
